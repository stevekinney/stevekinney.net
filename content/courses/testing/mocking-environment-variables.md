Maybe you want to make sure your code behaves as expected given different environment variables. You could get really fancy in the way you filter your testsâ€”or, you could just mock those environment variables for a hot minute.

Consider this example in `examples/logjam/src/log.test.js`.

```ts
describe('development', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.stubEnv('MODE', 'development');
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    vi.restoreAllMocks();
  });

  it('logs to the console in development mode', () => {
    const spy = vi.spyOn(console, 'log');

    log('Hello, world!');

    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Hello, world!');
  });
});
```

More importantly, we probably want to make sure that _doesn't_ log in production.

```ts
describe('production', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.stubEnv('MODE', 'production');
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    vi.restoreAllMocks();
  });

  it('does not log to the console in production mode', () => {
    const spy = vi.spyOn(console, 'log');

    log('Hello, world!');

    expect(spy).not.toHaveBeenCalledWith('Hello, world!');
  });
});
```
