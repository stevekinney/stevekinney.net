Let's say you can't find the `expect` method that makes you happy. You _could_ extend the matchers in Vitest.

```javascript
// vitest.setup.js
import { expect } from 'vitest';

expect.extend({
	toBeWithinRange(received, min, max) {
		const pass = received >= min && received <= max;
		if (pass) {
			return {
				message: () => `expected ${received} not to be within range ${min} - ${max}`,
				pass: true,
			};
		} else {
			return {
				message: () => `expected ${received} to be within range ${min} - ${max}`,
				pass: false,
			};
		}
	},
});
```

Let's see it in action.

```javascript
test('number is within range', () => {
	expect(10).toBeWithinRange(5, 15);
});
```

## A More Interesting Example

Letâ€™s say youâ€™re working with **dates**. Testing for "is this date after that date?" could be a little annoying with vanilla matchers.

Hereâ€™s a custom matcher for checking if one date is later than another:

```js
expect.extend({
	toBeLaterThan(received, comparedDate) {
		const pass = new Date(received) > new Date(comparedDate);
		if (pass) {
			return {
				message: () => `expected ${received} not to be later than ${comparedDate}`,
				pass: true,
			};
		} else {
			return {
				message: () => `expected ${received} to be later than ${comparedDate}`,
				pass: false,
			};
		}
	},
});
```

Boom! Now you can write some crisp, clear date comparisons:

```js
test('date comparison', () => {
	expect('2023-10-10').toBeLaterThan('2023-09-01'); // âœ… True.
	expect('2023-05-15').toBeLaterThan('2023-07-01'); // ðŸ’£ False.
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep the matcher simple**. You donâ€™t want to write a novel for each matcher. Remember, code is read more often than itâ€™s written, so make sure that your custom matcher is easy to understand at a glance.
2. **Detailed error messages**. When a test fails, the developer (spoiler: future you) needs to understand _why_ things exploded. A good message makes debugging way less painful.
3. **Leverage context for your app**. Extend matchers when you find yourself repeating specific checks. In the land of testing, **DRY** doesnâ€™t just stand for "Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself", it stands for "**Donâ€™t Rage Yet**", because tests are meant to stay calm and concise.
