Way back [in the beginning](the-basics.md), we got `add` working, but let's up our game. Let's assume we've got a button that increments a counter when clicked. We want to test that the user sees the count increase.

We'll need to adjust our setup a bit for the DOM:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Counter</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      <p id="counter">0</p>
      <button id="increment">Increment</button>
    </div>

    <script>
      const counterElement = document.getElementById('counter');
      const buttonElement = document.getElementById('increment');
      let count = 0;

      buttonElement.addEventListener('click', () => {
        count += 1;
        counterElement.textContent = count;
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's the test for that behavior:

```js
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('Counter app', () => {
  it('should increment the count when the button is clicked', () => {
    // Set up DOM
    document.body.innerHTML = `
      <p id="counter">0</p>
      <button id="increment">Increment</button>
    `;

    const button = document.getElementById('increment');
    const counter = document.getElementById('counter');

    // Fake our state
    let count = 0;
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      count += 1;
      counter.textContent = count;
    });

    // Simulate the button click
    button.click();

    // Check if the behavior is what we expect
    expect(counter.textContent).toBe('1');
  });
});
```

Rather than testing the internal state directly, we're checking **the thing we care about most**—what the user sees: that number goes up when the button is clicked. Now when some poor soul is maintaining your app in the future, they can _immediately tell_ what's going on—oh, button click equals counter change, cool. They don't have to dig into how the inner state of `count` works.

## Mocking DOM Methods

Sometimes you need to mock up DOM methods or third-party services—stuff that gets a little trickier in tests. Let's mock the `getElementById` function to see how easy it is in Vitest:

```js
import { describe, it, vi } from 'vitest';

describe('DOM tests', () => {
  it('should call getElementById', () => {
    const spy = vi.spyOn(global.document, 'getElementById').mockReturnValue({
      textContent: '0',
    });

    const element = document.getElementById('counter');

    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(element.textContent).toBe('0');

    spy.mockRestore();
  });
});
```

You just mocked `getElementById` and verified it was called. Vitest comes with a mocking library built-in, so you don't need to yank in extra dependencies just for the basics like spies, mocks, and stubs.
