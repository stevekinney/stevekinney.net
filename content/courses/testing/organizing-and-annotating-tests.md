There are two primary ways in which we can organize our tests:

1. We can break them out into different files.
2. We can use `describe` to create some kind of logical grouping.

I respect you too much to explain how files work to you, so let's focus our attention on the second item.

## `describe`

You can group a set of tests into a suite using `describe`. If you don't use `describe`, all of the tests in a given file as grouped in a suite automatically.

The is primarily used for organizing your tests. It's helpful because it allows you to skip or isolate a particular group of tests.

```ts
✓ arithmetic.ts (8)
  ✓ add (2)
    ✓ should add two numbers correctly
    ✓ should not add two numbers incorrectly
  ✓ subtract (2)
    ✓ should subtract the subtrahend from the minuend
    ✓ should not subtract two numbers incorrectly
  ✓ multiply (2)
    ✓ should multiply the multiplicand by the multiplier
    ✓ should not multiply two numbers incorrectly
  ✓ divide (2)
    ✓ should multiply the multiplicand by the multiplier
    ✓ should not multiply two numbers incorrectly
```

### Benefits of Using `describe`

- **Improved Readability**: Logical grouping makes it easier to understand what is being tested.
- **Shared Setup and Teardown**: Utilize hooks like `beforeEach` and `afterEach` within a `describe` block for shared setup.
- **Selective Execution**: Run or skip entire groups of tests during development.
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Reflect the structure of your application in your tests.

## Hooks

Using `describe` allows you to pass a name to your suite, which is helpful when you're debugging. It also gives you access to some helpful hooks:

- `beforeEach`: Runs before each and every test.
- `afterEach`: Runs after each and every test.
- `beforeAll`: Runs at the very beginning when the suite starts.
- `afterAll`: Runs after all of the tests in the suite have completed.

We'll cover this a bit more when we get to [setting up and tearing down with hooks](setting-up-and-tearing-down-with-hooks.md).

## Annotations

These are fairly similar to what we saw with our individual tests.

`describe` also has some annotations that add some logic to if any when the suite should run:

- `describe.skip`: Skip this suite.
- `describe.skipIf`: Skip this suite if the provided value is truthy.
- `describe.only`: Only run this suite (and any others that use `.only` as well, of course). You probably _don't_ want to accidentally commit this. Trust me. It's embarassing.
- `describe.todo`: Marks a suite as something you're going to implement later. This is helpful when you know the kinds of tests that you'll need and and want to keep track of how many you have less.
- `describe.each`: Used for generating a multiple suites on based on a collection of data. This is covered more in [Parameterizing Tests](parameterizing-tests.md).
- `describe.concurrent`: Run all of the tests in this suite concurrently. This is covered more in [Parallelizing Tests](parallelizing-tests.md).
- `describe.shuffle`: Run these tests in a random order.

This is also covered a bit in [Filtering Tests](filtering-tests.md).

### Best Practices

#### Group Tests by Functionality

Organize tests around specific functionalities or features.

```javascript
describe('Math Utilities', () => {
	test('adds numbers correctly', () => {
		// Test code
	});

	test('multiplies numbers correctly', () => {
		// Test code
	});
});
```

#### Use Nested `describe` Blocks for Complex Structures

For complex modules, nesting can mirror the application's structure.

```javascript
describe('User Module', () => {
	describe('Authentication', () => {
		test('successfully logs in with valid credentials', () => {
			// Test code
		});

		test('fails to log in with invalid credentials', () => {
			// Test code
		});
	});

	describe('Profile Management', () => {
		test('updates user profile', () => {
			// Test code
		});
	});
});
```

#### Write Clear and Descriptive Names

Names should clearly state what is being tested.

```javascript
describe('Array', () => {
	describe('push', () => {
		test('adds an element to the end of the array', () => {
			// Test code
		});
	});
});
```

#### Utilize Hooks Within `describe` Blocks

Use `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `beforeAll`, and `afterAll` to manage setup and teardown specific to a test suite.

```javascript
describe('Database Tests', () => {
	beforeAll(() => {
		// Connect to database
	});

	afterAll(() => {
		// Disconnect from database
	});

	beforeEach(() => {
		// Seed database
	});

	test('fetches a record successfully', () => {
		// Test code
	});
});
```

#### Keep Tests Focused and Independent

Each test should focus on a single aspect, and tests within a `describe` block should be related but independent.

```javascript
describe('String Manipulation', () => {
	test('converts string to uppercase', () => {
		// Test code
	});

	test('trims whitespace from string', () => {
		// Test code
	});
});
```

#### Avoid Excessive Nesting

Too much nesting can make tests hard to read. Keep the structure as flat as possible while maintaining clarity. Don't get carried away.

```javascript
// Instead of deeply nested describes
describe('Module A', () => {
	describe('Component B', () => {
		describe('Function C', () => {
			test('performs action X', () => {
				// Test code
			});
		});
	});
});

// Prefer a flatter structure
describe('Component B - Function C', () => {
	test('performs action X', () => {
		// Test code
	});
});
```

#### Use `describe` for Shared Context

Group tests that share the same setup or context.

```javascript
describe('When user is authenticated', () => {
	beforeEach(() => {
		// Mock authentication
	});

	test('accesses protected route', () => {
		// Test code
	});

	test('sees personalized content', () => {
		// Test code
	});
});
```

#### Employ `describe.only` and `describe.skip` During Development

Focus on specific test suites without running the entire test suite.

- `describe.only`: Runs only the specified suite.
- `describe.skip`: Skips the specified suite.

```javascript
describe.only('Critical Functionality Tests', () => {
	// Tests to focus on
});

describe.skip('Deprecated Functionality Tests', () => {
	// Tests to skip
});
```

Remember to remove `.only` and `.skip` before finalizing your code to ensure all tests are executed.

#### Document Complex Test Cases

Add comments to explain non-obvious tests or setups within `describe` blocks.

```javascript
describe('Edge Cases for Date Parsing', () => {
	// Tests for leap years and time zones
	test('correctly parses leap day', () => {
		// Test code
	});
});
```

### Key Takeaways

- **Logical Grouping**: Use `describe` to group related tests, enhancing clarity.
- **Shared Setup**: Utilize hooks within `describe` blocks for setup and teardown specific to a group.
- **Descriptive Naming**: Clear names for `describe` and `test` improve readability.
- **Test Isolation**: Keep tests independent to avoid unintended interactions.
- **Avoid Over-Nesting**: Keep the structure simple to maintain readability.
- **Reflect Project Structure**: Organize test files to mirror the source code layout.
- **Focus During Development**: Use `.only` and `.skip` to streamline the testing process.
- **Documentation**: Comment complex tests or setups for future reference.
