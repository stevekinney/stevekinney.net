Let's take a look at `examples/element-factory/src/secret-input.test.js` again. We have some functionality where the input field can be pre-populated with whatever is currently in `localStorage`. Let's say that we want to both stub the value of `localStorage` and also be able to introspect the parameters that `localStorage.getItem` was called with.

Let's start by modifying our setup:

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.spyOn(localStorage, 'getItem').mockReturnValue('test secret');
  vi.spyOn(localStorage, 'setItem');

  document.body.innerHTML = '';
  document.body.appendChild(createSecretInput());
});
```

Now, let's say that we want to take a look at whether or not the input has the correct value _and_ if it was pulling that value from `localStorage`.

```javascript
it('should have loaded the secret from localStorage', async () => {
  expect(screen.getByLabelText('Secret')).toHaveValue('test secret');
  expect(localStorage.getItem).toHaveBeenCalledWith('secret');
});
```

We can also do the same for setting the value. Bear in mind, since the secret is loaded from `localStorage`, you'll need to clear out the input field before typing into it.

```javascript
it('should save the secret to localStorage', async () => {
  const input = screen.getByLabelText('Secret');
  const button = screen.getByText('Store Secret');

  await userEvent.clear(input);
  await userEvent.type(input, 'new secret');
  await userEvent.click(button);

  expect(localStorage.setItem).toHaveBeenCalledWith('secret', 'new secret');
});
```
