> [!NOTE] About model names and what’s current
> This page preserves the “Codex” framing because it matches the course recordings. In current OpenAI terminology, you’ll typically use the o‑series and GPT‑4o family for coding tasks (for example, o3 or o3‑mini for strong reasoning and low‑latency iterations, and GPT‑4o variants when you want multimodal context like screenshots or diagrams). The Assistants API and Realtime API are the common integration surfaces. The guidance below still maps well: where this page says “Codex,” think “current OpenAI coding models (o‑series/GPT‑4o) used with your repo, tests, and PR flow.”

> [!IMPORTANT] Historical context
> “OpenAI Codex” as a model name has been superseded. We keep the original language to stay faithful to the course and to illustrate a robust agent workflow. When implementing today, substitute the current model you prefer (e.g., o3 for reasoning‑heavy refactors or GPT‑4o for code + images) without changing the overall workflow: connect the repo, write tasks, run tests, and produce verifiable patches/PRs.

OpenAI Codex is an artificial intelligence model and a cloud-based software engineering agent developed by OpenAI, designed to transform how developers interact with codebases and build software. It is also available as a lightweight, open-source command-line interface (CLI) tool.

Here's a detailed breakdown of what OpenAI Codex is:

## Core Identity and Purpose

- Codex is an **AI model that translates plain language into code**. It acts as a **co-pilot for coding**, designed to handle routine and overwhelming parts of software engineering, allowing developers to focus on higher-level thinking. It aims to become an **indispensable part of a developer's toolkit**.
- It is considered an "autonomous software engineer" (A-SWE) agent and operates as a "senior programmer" that can work alongside developers 24 hours a day.

## Underlying Technology and Models

- At its core, Codex utilizes **machine learning and deep learning**. It's built on the **same base as GPT-3** and is described here as powered by a specialized “codex-1” model for code work. In today’s stack, you would choose an o‑series model (e.g., o3 or o3‑mini) or a GPT‑4o family model depending on the task (see the callout above).
- A smaller version, described here as “codex‑mini,” maps well to a lightweight, lower‑latency model choice (for example, o3‑mini or a 4o‑mini variant) for quick edits, Q&A, and iterative drafts.
- The model's training objective is to generate code that functions flawlessly, mirrors human stylistic preferences, adheres precisely to instructions, and can iteratively run tests until a passing result is achieved. It is trained on massive amounts of public code repositories, tutorials, and open-source projects.

## Key Capabilities and Features

Codex is engineered to handle a diverse range of tasks, including:

- **Writing new features**.
- **Answering intricate questions about a codebase**.
- **Identifying and fixing bugs**.
- **Drafting GitHub pull requests automatically**.
- **Navigating codebases** to suggest improvements.
- **Running lint and tests** to ensure code quality.
- **Explaining overall code structure**.
- **Reviewing for minor issues** such as typos or broken tests.
- **Generating multiple implementation suggestions** for a task ("Best-of-N").
- **Converting code to use different frameworks** (e.g., converting NUI to React).
- **Automating boilerplate code generation and scripting** for various applications.
- **Assisting in learning and coding education** by explaining concepts and troubleshooting errors.
- **Enhancing code review and debugging** by spotting bugs or suggesting improvements.
- **Managing Git workflows**, including creating commits, PRs, and resolving merge conflicts.
- **Onboarding developers to unfamiliar codebases** quickly.

## Operational Modes and Environments

- **Cloud-Based Agent (ChatGPT Codex)**: This version runs in **isolated cloud sandbox environments**. Each task is processed independently in its own container, preloaded with the relevant codebase, allowing Codex to read, edit files, and execute commands without interference. Internet access is typically disabled during task execution for security, though it can be optionally enabled by admins. Tasks typically range from 1 to 30 minutes in completion time, with a hard cutoff of an hour in development mode.
- **Codex CLI**: A local-first architecture, originally built with Node.js and transitioning to native Rust for enhanced efficiency and security. It operates with configurable autonomy levels:
  - **Suggest Mode**: Reads files but requires approval for changes.
  - **Auto Edit Mode**: Automatically applies file changes but requires command approval.
  - **Full Auto Mode**: Executes both file operations and commands without requiring approval. Full auto mode increases sandboxing for safety.

## Workflow and Interaction

- Developers access Codex through a dedicated section in the ChatGPT sidebar. They connect a GitHub repository or organization, and Codex filters repositories they have access to.
- Tasks can be assigned by typing a prompt and initiating "Code" for file mutations and patches, or "Ask" for codebase questions. Codex supports **parallel processing**, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously. Power users can comfortably run up to **60 concurrent instances per hour** during the research preview.
- Codex provides **verifiable evidence of its actions** through citations of terminal logs and test outputs. Once a task is completed, it commits its changes within its environment and allows users to open a GitHub pull request or integrate changes locally.
- **Guidance via AGENTS.md**: Developers can guide Codex's behavior using `AGENTS.md` files within the repository. These files serve as a communication channel, informing Codex how to navigate the codebase, which commands to run for testing, and how to adhere to project coding standards. Instructions in `AGENTS.md` take precedence based on nesting depth, though direct user prompts can override them.
- **Prompting Habits**: Effective prompts are clear and detailed, similar to assigning work to a junior engineer, focusing on clear goals, success criteria, and testing instructions. Providing existing tests is encouraged, as Codex optimizes for passing them. It's recommended to chunk work into many narrow tasks for parallelism.

## Benefits and Limitations

- **Benefits**: Boosts productivity, speeds up prototyping, makes coding more accessible, automates repetitive tasks, and allows developers to offload complex tasks. It produces cleaner, more reviewable patches compared to general-purpose models.
- **Limitations**: It may produce inaccurate code, miss complex logic, or have biases from training data. It might occasionally generate "code hallucinations" referencing non-existent components. It requires WSL for Windows support. Users must still manually review and validate all agent-generated code before integration. It lacks features like image inputs for frontend development and the ability to course-correct mid-task.
