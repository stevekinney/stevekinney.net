**Claude Opus** and **Claude Sonnet** represent different points on an "agency spectrum" for AI coding systems. I guess there is also Haiku.

## Claude Opus: The "Development Partner" for Complexity

Opus is considered the **highest capability model** and demonstrates **genuine development partnership**, capable of internalizing objectives, working persistently, and proactively identifying and resolving obstacles. It's ideal for tasks requiring **maximum reasoning** and **complex trade-offs**.

### Key Use Cases for Opus

- **Creative tasks requiring nuanced understanding**.
- **Code reviews requiring architectural judgment**.
- **Complex refactoring across multiple systems**.
- **Large-scale system design**.
- **Complex algorithm development**.
- **Research and advanced analysis**.
- **Multi-system integration**.
- **Advanced problem solving**.
- **Machine Learning architecture**.
- **Advanced technical writing**.
- **High-level planning and final review**.
- **Initial builds based on project plans in `CLAUDE.md`**.
- **Adding entire new modules**.
- **Thorough codebase analysis and architectural understanding**.
- **Complex root cause analysis for debugging**.
- **Integrating disparate information sources for comprehensive understanding**.
- **Creating final integrated reports and strategic proposals**.

Opus excels at **strategic-level analysis** and makes more **cautious and iterative approaches**, often using more turns (interactions) to complete a task. For instance, Claude Opus 4 needed only two follow-up prompts to create a fully functional OmniFocus plugin and proactively enhanced it with configuration interfaces, error handling, input validation, and progress indicators. It can even **autonomously decide tradeoffs** and dynamically adjust resource allocation and review cycles for quality.

## Claude Sonnet: The "Collaborative Agent" and Production Workhorse

Sonnet is seen as a **production standard model** and acts as a **collaborative agent** that balances instruction-following with initiative, working semi-autonomously with periodic guidance. It is a **great workhorse** suitable for **standard feature implementation and development tasks**. Many users find Sonnet perfectly adequate for most coding tasks.

### Key Use Cases for Sonnet

- **Standard feature implementation and development tasks**.
- **Most debugging and troubleshooting scenarios**.
- **Code generation with moderate complexity**.
- **Documentation writing and editing**.
- **Task coordination and workflow management**.
- **Enterprise applications**.
- **Security-critical code**.
- **Standard system architecture**.
- **Code reviews requiring adherence to standards**.
- **Compliance audits**.
- **Customer-facing projects and open-source projects**.
- **Creating secure user authentication systems**.
- **General implementation tasks**.
- **Structural analysis (directory structure, configuration files)**.
- **Pattern extraction (code conventions, naming rules)**.
- **Data transformation (CSV generation, mapping creation)**.
- **Routine investigation tasks**.
- **Small, specific tasks that require less "thinking" or "creativity"**.
- **Debugging production issues**.

Sonnet is generally **faster and cheaper** than Opus, making it the **default choice for most users**. It can handle complex tasks but might require more explicit guidance at the development stage compared to Opus.

## Claude Haiku: The "Responsive Assistant" for Simple, Fast Tasks

While not the main focus, **Haiku** is the **cheapest and fastest** model, best suited for **simple, routine tasks** that do not require complex reasoning or extensive context. It is recommended for:

- **Simple file reads and basic content extraction**.
- **Routine formatting and style corrections**.
- **Basic syntax validation and linting**.
- **Simple text transformations and data parsing**.
- **Quick status checks and basic analysis**.
- **Simple utility scripts or throwaway code**.

Haiku provides the **most compact output** and generally uses the **fewest turns**.

## Performance and Cost Implications

Using Claude Code, especially Opus, can be **expensive**.

- **Cost**: Opus is approximately **5 times more expensive than Sonnet**, and about **20 times more expensive than Haiku**.
- **Speed**: Haiku is the fastest (27 seconds for a test task), followed by Opus (76 seconds), and then Sonnet (86 seconds). However, some sources suggest Sonnet can be faster for quick answers.
- **Output Detail**: Sonnet often provides the most detailed output in terms of token count, followed by Opus, and then Haiku.
- **Context Window**: Claude models offer large context windows, like Claude 2 with up to 100k tokens. However, continuously long conversations can lead to degraded responses and increased token usage.

### Cost Optimization Strategies

- **Hybrid Model Approach**: Use the more expensive models (like Opus) only for critical, low-frequency tasks (e.g., high-level planning, final review) and cheaper, faster models (like Sonnet) for the bulk of high-frequency implementation work. For example, use Opus for the foundational understanding phase, then switch to Sonnet for implementation, and back to Opus for review.
- **Context Management**: Regularly use `/clear` to reset conversation history, especially when switching tasks, to prevent irrelevant context from increasing token usage. The `/compact` command can summarize the conversation, reducing token count while retaining important context. Claude Code can even auto-compact when it reaches 95% capacity.
- **Prompt Caching / Foundation Session**: Utilizing a "foundation session" can drastically reduce token costs by caching the initial large context prompt and reusing it across subsequent calls. This can lead to **60-90% token cost reduction** and faster execution.
- **Fixed-Cost Subscription Plans**: Plans like Anthropic's Claude Max offer predictable costs, de-risking experimentation with large-scale agent usage.
- **Safeguards**: For automated workflows, configure limits on maximum turns (`--max-turns`) or runtime to prevent runaway costs.

## How to Choose Which Model to Use

The choice of model depends on the **task complexity**, **quality requirements**, and **cost considerations**.

### General Guidelines (5-Second Rule)

- If you spend more than 5 seconds thinking about which model to use:
  - For **complex design/research**: **Use `opus`**.
  - For **everything else**: **Use `sonnet`**.
- The quality difference can be significant, so when in doubt, choose the higher capability model.

### Decision Tree / Scenarios

- **Highest complexity/scale work, research, advanced analysis, architectural judgment**: `Opus`.
- **Production use, security/auth, standard enterprise applications, code reviews, compliance audits**: `Sonnet`.
- **Simple utilities/scripts, basic file operations, routine formatting, personal/throwaway code**: `Haiku`.
- **Red Flags**: Always use `Sonnet` if user data, money/payments, authentication/authorization, external API integration, database operations, concurrent operations, file uploads, email sending, cryptographic operations, or third-party dependencies are involved.

**Migration Checklist** from Haiku to Sonnet (or higher): Upgrade from `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` to `Sonnet` when:

- Adding authentication.
- Connecting to a database.
- Handling user input.
- Going to production.
- Others will use the code.
- Security matters.
- Performance matters.

## How to Switch Models in Claude Code

You can switch models using the `/model` slash command within an interactive Claude Code session. For example, type `/model` and then select from the available options (e.g., Opus, Sonnet, or a specific full model name like `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` or `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`). Alternatively, you can specify the model directly when starting Claude Code using the `--model` flag: `claude --model claude-opus-4-20250514`.

## Leveraging `CLAUDE.md` for Enhanced Model Performance

Regardless of the model chosen, providing **relevant context significantly improves Claude Code's output quality**. The `CLAUDE.md` file is a **special Markdown file** that Claude automatically reads at the start of every session, serving as a persistent, project-specific memory and instruction manual.

- **Adherence Hierarchy**: `CLAUDE.md` instructions are treated as **immutable system rules** that define operational boundaries, taking precedence over user prompts, which are interpreted as flexible requests. This ensures consistent process execution and persistent context.
- **Content**: Use `CLAUDE.md` to document project architecture, coding standards, common commands, core files, project workflows, and any unexpected behaviors or warnings.
- **Modularity**: For larger projects, link to other Markdown files (e.g., `@docs/testing.md`) within your `CLAUDE.md` to keep the main file concise and prevent "instruction bleed". This allows Claude to pull in specific files only when relevant, optimizing token usage.
- **Refinement**: Treat `CLAUDE.md` as a living document that you constantly refine based on Claude's performance. You can quickly add instructions by typing `#` at the start of your input, which prompts Claude to store it in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Hierarchical Memory**: Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` files from your user directory (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) for global preferences, and then from the project root (`./CLAUDE.md`) for project-specific guidelines, and also from subdirectories. This allows for granular control.
- **Clarity and Specificity**: Be explicit and detailed in your instructions, using Markdown headings and bullet points for organization. Avoid vague requests.
