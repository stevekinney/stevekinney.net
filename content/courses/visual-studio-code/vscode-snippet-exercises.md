1. **Basic Function:** Create a snippet that, when you type `func`, generates a basic TypeScript function declaration. It should include placeholders for the function name, parameters, and return type, with tab stops to easily navigate between them. Add a descriptive label.
2. **Arrow Function:** Design a snippet triggered by `arrfunc` that creates a basic TypeScript arrow function. Include placeholders for the variable name, parameters, and return type, with tab stops for navigation. Add a description.
3. **Async Function:** Develop a snippet with the prefix `asyncfunc` that generates an asynchronous TypeScript function declaration. It should have placeholders for the function name, parameters, and return type (within a `Promise`), and use tab stops for easy editing. Include a description.
4. **Basic Class:** Create a snippet that, upon typing `class`, generates a basic TypeScript class structure, including the `constructor`. Use placeholders for the class name and constructor parameters, with tab stops for easy filling. Add a description and ensure it spans multiple lines.
5. **Class Method:** Design a snippet with the prefix `classmethod` to generate a public method within a TypeScript class. Include placeholders for the method name, parameters, and return type, with tab stops for navigation. Add a description.
6. **Private Property:** Develop a snippet triggered by `privateprop` to quickly declare a private property within a TypeScript class. Include placeholders for the property name and its type, with tab stops. Add a description.
7. **Basic Import:** Create a snippet that, when you type `import`, generates a basic TypeScript import statement using curly braces for named imports. Include placeholders for the module name(s) and the import path. Add a description.
8. **Import All:** Design a snippet with the prefix `importall` to generate a TypeScript import statement that imports all modules from a path under a given alias. Include placeholders for the alias and the import path. Add a description.
9. **Type Alias:** Develop a snippet with the prefix `typealias` to declare a TypeScript type alias. Include placeholders for the type name and the type definition. Add a description.
10. **Promise:** Design a snippet with the prefix `promise` to generate a basic structure for creating a new `Promise` in TypeScript, including the `resolve` and `reject` callbacks. Include a placeholder for the Promise's type and another for the body of the Promise. Ensure it's multiline and has a description.
11. **Basic `fetch` Request:** Create a snippet that, when you type `ffetch`, sets up the basic structure for a `fetch` request in TypeScript. It should include placeholders for the URL, the HTTP method (consider using a choice placeholder for 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE', 'GET'), and an empty `body` (for relevant methods). Include basic error handling with a `try`/`catch`. Use tab stops to navigate through the URL, method, and body. Add a description.
12. **Import Default Export:** Design a snippet triggered by `importdef` that generates a TypeScript import statement specifically for importing the `default` export from a module. It should include placeholders for the variable name that will hold the default export and the path to the module. Add a description.
13. **Basic Express Route:** Develop a snippet with the prefix `expressroute` that lays out the basic structure of an Express route handler in TypeScript. It should include placeholders for the route path, the HTTP method (consider a choice placeholder for `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`), and the request (`req`), response (`res`), and next (`next`) parameters. Include a basic `res.send()` or similar within the handler. Ensure it's multiline and has a description.
14. **Basic React Component:** Create a snippet that, upon typing `rc`, generates the basic structure of a functional React component in TypeScript. It should include placeholders for the component name, and a basic return statement with a `div` or similar. Consider including a basic import for `React` if needed. Ensure it's multiline and has a description.
15. **File Header Snippet:** Create a snippet that, when you type `fileheader`, generates a standard file header comment in TypeScript, automatically including the current filename and the current date. Use the appropriate VS Code predefined variables for this. Add a description.
16. **Transform to Uppercase:** Design a snippet with the prefix `toupper` that takes a word as input through a placeholder and then inserts both the original word and its uppercase version. Use a transform to convert the placeholder text to uppercase. Add a description.
17. **Surround with `try…catch`:** Develop a snippet with the prefix `trycatch` that is designed to surround selected TypeScript code with a `try…catch` block. It should use the `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT` variable to represent the highlighted code. Add a description.
