Some additional notes that we _probably_ won't get to, but I'll include here just in case.

## Workspace File Structure and Persistence

Multi-root workspaces are defined by a `.code-workspace` file, which not only lists the folders included in the workspace but also allows you to store workspace-specific settings and configurations. This file can be saved, version controlled, and shared with your team, ensuring that everyone uses a consistent development environment. For example:

```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "path": "frontend"
    },
    {
      "path": "backend"
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "editor.tabSize": 2,
    "files.exclude": {
      "**/node_modules": true
    }
  }
}
```

> [!TIP] Save your workspace as a `.code-workspace` file to easily reopen and share your multi-root configuration.

## Advanced Workspace Management

Visual Studio Code provides commands to manage workspace folders dynamically. Use the Command Palette to run **"Workspaces: Add Folder to Workspace"** or **"Workspaces: Remove Folder from Workspace"** to quickly adjust your workspace. You can also reorder folders by dragging them in the Explorer, allowing you to prioritize certain projects.

> [!TIP] Reordering your workspace folders can help maintain focus by placing the most critical projects at the top of your Explorer view.

## Version Control Across Multiple Folders

Each folder in a multi-root workspace can have its own version control settings, enabling you to work with separate Git repositories simultaneously. This means you can stage, commit, and push changes independently for each project while still benefiting from a unified interface. Additionally, workspace-level settings can help standardize linting and formatting rules across all projects.

> [!TIP] Leverage multi-root workspaces to keep repositories isolated but manage them in one window, reducing context switching between different VS Code instances.

## Integrated Task and Debugging Configurations

Multi-root workspaces allow you to define tasks and debugging configurations that span multiple folders. In your `.code-workspace` file, you can specify tasks that run commands in a particular folder or even trigger compound tasks across different projects. Similarly, workspace-level launch configurations can help you debug interactions between services, such as a front-end application connecting to a back-end API.

> [!TIP] Use compound configurations in your `launch.json` to start multiple services concurrently, ensuring a cohesive debugging experience across your entire project.
