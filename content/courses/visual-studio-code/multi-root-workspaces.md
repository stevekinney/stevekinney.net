Multi-root workspaces in Visual Studio Code allow you to work with **multiple, distinct project folders within a single Visual Studio Code window**. Instead of opening separate Visual Studio Code instances for each project, you can combine them into a workspace. This workspace acts as a container, bringing together these folders under one roof.

In contrast to **single-folder workspaces**, which are limited to a single root folder and its subfolders, multi-root workspaces break down this limitation. They enable you to:

- Open and manage several top-level folders simultaneously.
- View and navigate files from all included folders in the Explorer.
- Run tasks and debug code across different folders.
- Share settings and configurations across all projects within the workspace.

Think of a multi-root workspace as a project aggregator. It doesn't merge or restructure your project folders; it simply provides a unified interface to interact with them collectively.

## The Alleged Benefits

- **Managing Related Projects in a Unified Environment:** The most significant benefit is the ability to manage related but separate projects in one Visual Studio Code window. For instance, in a full-stack web application, you might have a front-end project in one folder and a back-end project in another. Multi-root workspaces allow you to open both folders together, eliminating the need to switch between different Visual Studio Code instances. This unified view simplifies project management and reduces cognitive load.
- **Sharing Settings, Configurations, and Extensions Across Projects:** Multi-root workspaces enable you to define settings, configurations, and extension recommendations at the workspace level. These settings apply to all folders within the workspace, ensuring consistency across related projects. You can still customize settings at the folder level if needed, providing a flexible and hierarchical configuration system. This sharing capability reduces redundancy and promotes a standardized development environment.
- **Simplifying Development Workflows for Microservices or Monorepos:** Multi-root workspaces are particularly well-suited for microservice architectures and monorepos. In microservices, you might have numerous independent services, each in its own repository. Multi-root workspaces allow you to open all relevant service repositories in one window, making it easier to develop, test, and debug interactions between services. Similarly, in monorepos, where multiple projects reside in a single repository, multi-root workspaces can help you focus on specific sub-projects while still having access to the entire repository's codebase.
- **Reducing Context Switching Between Different Visual Studio Code Windows:** Constantly switching between multiple Visual Studio Code windows can be disruptive and decrease productivity. Multi-root workspaces eliminate this context switching by bringing all relevant projects into a single window. This streamlined approach allows you to stay focused and maintain a smoother development flow, as you can easily navigate and work across different parts of your overall project without losing your train of thought.

## Use Cases

- **Full-Stack Web Development with Separate Front-End and Back-End Projects:** Developing a web application often involves distinct front-end and back-end projects, typically residing in separate folders or repositories. A multi-root workspace is ideal for this setup, allowing you to work on both the client-side and server-side code simultaneously. You can easily switch between front-end and back-end files, run tests for both, and debug the entire application from a single Visual Studio Code window.
- **Microservice Architectures with Multiple Independent Services:** Modern application development frequently employs microservices, where applications are broken down into small, independent services. Each microservice might be in its own repository. Multi-root workspaces are perfect for managing these architectures. You can open all the microservices that constitute a particular feature or application in a single workspace. This facilitates development, testing, and orchestration of microservices, as you can easily navigate between service codebases and manage them collectively.
- **Monorepo Projects with Shared Libraries or Components:** Monorepos, where multiple related projects are housed in a single repository, are becoming increasingly common. Multi-root workspaces can be used to effectively manage specific sub-projects within a monorepo. You can add only the relevant subfolders to your workspace, focusing on the parts you are currently working on, while still benefiting from the monorepo's shared codebase and version control. This approach provides a balance between focused development and access to the broader project context.
- **Working with Related Projects that Have Dependencies on Each Other:** Sometimes, you might work on projects that are not strictly front-end/back-end or microservices, but are still related and have dependencies on each other. For example, you might have a core library project and several applications that use this library. Multi-root workspaces can help you manage these dependencies effectively. You can include both the library project and the application projects in a workspace, making it easier to develop and test changes across the entire dependency chain.
