This comprehensive Visual Studio Code course covers a wide range of features to make you appear _way more_ productive than your co-workers.

> [!TIP] Example Repository
> We're going to be playing around with some of the examples in [this repository](https://github.com/stevekinney/vscode-examples).

We'll begin with editor basics including layout customization, command palette usage, integrated terminal, multiple cursor techniques, and navigation capabilities. Next, we'll dive into configuration management through settings precedence, and profiles.

More advanced topics include code snippets creation and management, task automation, debugging techniques from basic breakpoints to advanced data inspection, and source control integration with Git. The course also thoroughly explores Dev Containers functionality for creating consistent development environments.

The course emphasizes practical skills with dedicated sections on refactoring tools, search and replace operations, multi-root workspaces for managing multiple projects, and Emmet for faster HTML/CSS authoring. Throughout the modules, there's a balance between covering built-in functionality and highlighting useful extensions. Each topic includes detailed explanations, code examples, and best practices, with specific attention to keyboard shortcuts and command patterns that streamline the development experience. The material progressively builds from fundamental concepts to more specialized features, helping developers transition from basic usage to mastering Visual Studio Code as a powerful development environment.
