The Command Palette solves this by offering fuzzy-search across all commands. Even if you only remember part of a command’s name, typing snippets of it in the Command Palette often reveals exactly what you need. For instance, typing `pref key` might surface commands like `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts` or `Preferences: Open User Settings`.

As you get comfortable with the Command Palette, you’ll notice how partial matches quickly narrow down your options. This is incredibly useful for discovering new features or reminding yourself of rarely used commands. If you’re not sure what to type, just open the palette and scroll.

> [!TIP] Find; don't memorize
> Can’t recall a specific command name? Start typing related terms or synonyms. Visual Studio Code’s fuzzy-search often comes to the rescue, saving you from memory lapses.
