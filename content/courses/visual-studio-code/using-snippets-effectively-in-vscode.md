## Inserting Snippets

VS Code offers multiple ways to insert snippets, catering to different hot takes on the best way to insert them.

### Tab Completion (Prefix-Based Insertion)

This is the most common and efficient method for snippet insertion.

1. **Type Snippet Prefix:** In your editor, start typing the `prefix` of the snippet you want to use (e.g., `forloop`, `clog`, `rfc`).
2. **IntelliSense Suggestion:** As you type, VS Code's IntelliSense will suggest snippets that match your prefix. Snippets are usually indicated by a snippet icon (a square with a puzzle piece inside) in the suggestion list.
3. **Select and Insert:** Use the arrow keys or mouse to select your desired snippet from the suggestion list and press `Tab` or `Enter` to insert it.

### Insert Snippet Command

This is the most explicit way to insert a snippet.

1. **Open Command Palette:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. **Type "Insert Snippet":** Select **"Insert Snippet"** from the dropdown list.
3. **Choose Snippet:** A list of available snippets (based on the current file's language scope) will appear. Select the snippet you want to insert.

### Custom Key Bindings

For frequently used snippets, you can create custom key bindings for even faster insertion.

1. **Open Keyboard Shortcuts:** Go to `File` > `Preferences` > `Keyboard Shortcuts` (or `Code` > `Preferences` > `Keyboard Shortcuts` on macOS).
2. **Search for "Insert Snippet":** In the search bar, type "Insert Snippet".
3. **Edit Key Binding:** Double-click on the "Insert Snippet" command or right-click and select "Change Keybinding".
4. **Define Key Combination:** Press the desired key combination. Press `Enter` to confirm.
5. **Use Key Binding:** Now, when you press your defined key combination, the "Insert Snippet" command will be executed, and you can choose your snippet from the list.

> [!NOTE] You cannot bind to a particular snippet.
> While you can bind a key to the "Insert Snippet" command, you cannot directly bind a key combination to a _specific_ snippet. Key bindings are more useful for triggering the snippet selection menu quickly.

## Placeholder Navigation

Once you insert a snippet with placeholders, VS Code makes it easy to navigate and fill in the placeholder values:

- **Tab Key (`Tab`):** After snippet insertion, your cursor will automatically be positioned at the first placeholder (`$1`). Pressing the `Tab` key will jump the cursor to the next placeholder (`$2`), then `$3`, and so on, in numerical order.
- **Shift+Tab Keys (`Shift+Tab`):** To move backward through placeholders, press `Shift+Tab`. This will move the cursor to the previous placeholder in reverse numerical order.
- **Simultaneous Editing of Identical Placeholders:** If you use the same placeholder number multiple times in your snippet body (e.g., `${1:variableName}` used twice), editing the value of one instance will automatically update all other instances of the same placeholder number _within the current snippet insertion_. This is very useful for renaming variables or parameters consistently throughout a code block.

## Variable Transformation

Snippet variables become even more powerful when combined with transformations. Transformations allow you to modify the value of a variable before it's inserted into the snippet. The syntax for transformations is:

```ts
${variable_name/regular_expression/format_string/options}
```

Let's break down the transformation syntax:

- **`variable_name`:** The name of the variable you want to transform (e.g., `TM_FILENAME_BASE`, `CURRENT_YEAR`).
- **`/regular_expression/`:** A regular expression to match against the variable's value.
- **`format_string`:** The string to replace the matched text with. You can use special escape sequences within the `format_string`:
  - `$0`: Inserts the whole matched text.
  - `$1`, `$2`, â€¦ `$9`: Inserts the text captured by the corresponding capturing group in the regular expression.
- **`options` (Optional):** Flags to modify the regular expression matching behavior:
  - `i`: Case-insensitive matching.
  - `g`: Global matching (replace all occurrences).
  - `m`: Multiline mode.

### Convert Filename to Uppercase

```json
"Uppercase Filename": {
    "prefix": "upperfile",
    "body": [
        "// File: ${TM_FILENAME_BASE/^(.*)$/${1:/upcase}/}.js"
    ],
    "description": "Insert filename in uppercase"
}
```

- `TM_FILENAME_BASE`: Gets the filename without extension.
- `/^(.*)$/`: Matches the entire filename (captured in group 1).
- `/${1:/upcase}/`: Replaces the matched text with the uppercase version of capturing group 1 (`$1`).
- `/upcase`: A predefined transformation function to convert to uppercase. Other predefined functions include `/downcase`, `/capitalize`.

### Extract Year from Full Date

```JSON
"Year from Date": {
  "prefix": "yearfromdate",
  "body": [
	  "// Year: ${CURRENT_DATE/^(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})$/$1/}"
  ],
  "description": "Extract year from current date"
}
```

- `CURRENT_DATE`: Gets the current date (e.g., `2025-03-07`).
- `/^(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})$/`: Regular expression to match the YYYY-MM-DD format, capturing year, month, and day in groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
- `/$1/`: Replaces the matched text with only capturing group 1 (the year).

Variable transformations are incredibly powerful for dynamically adapting snippets to different contexts and formatting needs. Explore the [VS Code documentation on snippet syntax](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets%23_snippet-syntax&authuser=1) for more advanced transformation examples and options.

## Placeholder Options

Placeholders can be further customized using options to control their behavior:

- **Default Values:** As seen in `${1:array}`, you can provide a default value that will be inserted initially. If you don't want to change the default value, you can simply press `Tab` to move to the next placeholder.
- **Choices (Quick Pick Menus):** `${1|option1,option2,option3|}` creates a dropdown list of options, as discussed earlier.
- **Placeholder Transformations (within Placeholders):** You can even apply transformations _within_ placeholders. For instance, you could combine a variable and a transformation within a placeholder: `${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE/^(.*)$/${1:/capitalize}/}}`. This would capitalize the filename base and use it as a default value for the first placeholder.
- **Placeholder as a Snippet Trigger:** You can nest snippets and use a placeholder as a trigger for another snippet. When you reach a placeholder, typing a snippet prefix within it can trigger another snippet insertion within that placeholder. This is a key concept for creating nested snippets (discussed in the next section).
