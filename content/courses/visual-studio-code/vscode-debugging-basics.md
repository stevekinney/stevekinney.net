## Together

We're going to walk through the `maths` example in [this repository]

## Exercise: Debugging an Express Application

Set up a `launch.json`.

```json
{
	"version": "0.2.0",
	"configurations": [
		{
			"type": "node",
			"request": "launch",
			"name": "Launch Program",
			"skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
			"args": ["${workspaceFolder}/index.js"]
		}
	]
}
```
