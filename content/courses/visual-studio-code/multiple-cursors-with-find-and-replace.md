> [!tip] This is it's own section because I think it's _super helpful_ and I didn't want to forget about it.

Here's the slick way to turn your search results into multiple cursors in Visual Studio Code:

1. **Open the Find box**: Press Ctrl+F (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+F (macOS).
2. **Enter your search term**: Type whatever you're looking for in the file.
3. **Select all matches**: One common shortcut is **Alt+Enter** (Windows/Linux) or **Option+Enter** (macOS). This will create a cursor at each match found.
4. **Edit simultaneously**: Each match now has its own cursor, so your edits or insertions will be applied everywhere at once.
