Here are some possible solutions to [these exercises](vscode-emmet-exercises.md).

## Basic Paragraph

```css
p{Hello, world!}
```

A classic statement—you can swap the text for anything that tickles your fancy.

## Simple Unordered List

```css
ul>li{Item}*3
```

This one gives you three list items shouting "Item"—perfect for when you need some simple repetition.

## Image Element with Attributes

```css
img[src='image.jpg'][alt='Placeholder Image']
```

No frills here: an image tag with source and alt text. It's like the basic outfit of HTML images.

## Nested Div Structure

```css
div>div
```

A parent div holding a child div. It's as simple as nesting your hopes in a dream.

## Header with Navigation

```css
header>nav>ul>li*2
```

A header with a nav that wraps a list of two items. It's a mini layout that's as straightforward as it gets.
