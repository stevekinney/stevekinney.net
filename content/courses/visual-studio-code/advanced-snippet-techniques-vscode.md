Let's take a quick moment and look at two advanced strategies before we move on.

- Using Nested Snippets
- Using Regular Expressions in Snippets

## Nested Snippets

Nested snippets allow you to create complex code generation workflows by inserting snippets within other snippets. This is achieved by using placeholders as snippet triggers.

**Example: Nested React Component Snippet:**

Let's say you have a basic React component snippet and a separate snippet for PropTypes. You can nest the PropTypes snippet within the component snippet.

**Basic React Component Snippet (`react-component.json`):**

```json
"React Functional Component": {
    "prefix": "rfc",
    "body": [
        "import React from 'react';",
        "",
        "const ${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE/^(.*)$/${1:/pascalcase}/}} = (props) => {",
        "\treturn (",
        "\t\t<div>",
        "\t\t\t${0}",
        "\t\t</div>",
        "\t);",
        "};",
        "",
        "export default ${1};"
    ],
    "description": "React functional component"
}
```

**PropTypes Snippet (`react-proptypes.json`):**

```json
"React PropTypes": {
    "prefix": "proptypes",
    "body": [
        "import PropTypes from 'prop-types';",
        "",
        "${1:ComponentName}.propTypes = {",
        "\t${0}",
        "};"
    ],
    "description": "React PropTypes definition"
}
```

**Nesting them:** To nest, modify the React Component snippet (`react-component.json`) to include a placeholder that triggers the PropTypes snippet. Replace the `export default ${1};` line with:

```json
'export default ${1};', '${2:proptypes}'; // Placeholder that triggers "proptypes" snippet
```

Now, the modified `react-component.json` becomes:

```json
"React Functional Component with PropTypes": { // Renamed snippet
    "prefix": "rfcp", // New prefix
    "body": [
        "import React from 'react';",
        "",
        "const ${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE/^(.*)$/${1:/pascalcase}/}} = (props) => {",
        "\treturn (",
        "\t\t<div>",
        "\t\t\t${0}",
        "\t\t</div>",
        "\t);",
        "};",
        "",
        "export default ${1};",
        "${2:proptypes}" // Placeholder that triggers "proptypes" snippet
    ],
    "description": "React functional component with PropTypes" // Updated description
}
```

**How Nested Snippets Work:**

1. Insert the "React Functional Component with PropTypes" snippet using the `rfcp` prefix.
2. Fill in the component name at placeholder `$1`.
3. Press `Tab` to move to placeholder `$2`.
4. Now, within the `$2` placeholder, type the prefix of the "React PropTypes" snippet, which is `proptypes`.
5. VS Code will suggest the "React PropTypes" snippet. Select it.
6. The "React PropTypes" snippet will be inserted _within_ the `$2` placeholder of the "React Functional Component" snippet, effectively nesting them.

Nested snippets allow you to create modular and reusable code templates, building complex structures from smaller, manageable snippets.

## Regular Expressions in Snippets

We've already seen regular expressions in variable transformations. Snippets support full regular expression syntax for powerful text matching and manipulation. You can use regular expressions in:

- **Variable Transformations:** As demonstrated earlier, to modify variable values.
- **Conditional Snippet Insertion (Indirectly):** While snippets don't have direct conditional logic, you can use regular expressions in transformations to achieve conditional effects. For example, you could use a regular expression to check if a filename matches a certain pattern and insert different code based on the match.

**Example: Conditional Comment based on File Extension (Conceptual):**

While direct conditional snippet insertion isn't built-in, you can use transformations to achieve similar effects. This example is more conceptual as snippets are primarily for code insertion, not dynamic branching based on complex conditions.

```json
"Conditional Comment": {
    "prefix": "condcomment",
    "body": [
        "${TM_FILENAME/.js$/// JavaScript Comment/.py$/# Python Comment/}", // Conditional comment based on extension
        "${0}"
    ],
    "description": "Conditional comment based on file extension"
}
```

- `${TM_FILENAME/.js$/// JavaScript Comment/.py$/# Python Comment/}`: This is a transformation that acts like a conditional statement.
  - `.js$`: Regular expression to match `.js` at the end of the filename. If it matches, replace with `// JavaScript Comment`.
  - `.py$`: If the `.js$` regex _doesn't_ match, try to match `.py$` at the end of the filename. If it matches, replace with `# Python Comment`.
  - If neither `.js$` nor `.py$` matches, no replacement happens (the original filename is effectively used, which is not ideal in this example, but you can adjust the regex for more complex scenarios).

This example demonstrates the _idea_ of conditional behavior using regular expressions in transformations. However, for truly complex conditional logic, you might need to consider creating a VS Code extension instead of relying solely on snippets.
