These are the notes for my [React && TypeScript workshop](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/react-typescript-v3/) for [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com).

> [!TODO] Prerequisites
>
> - Solid understanding of React fundamentals (components, hooks, state management)
> - Basic JavaScript/ES6+ knowledge
> - Familiarity with modern build tools (npm/pnpm, bundlers)
> - Basic TypeScript knowledge helpful but not required

## What You'll Learn

This course covers the complete spectrum of React TypeScript development:

- **Type-Safe Components**: Learn to properly type props, state, and component patterns
- **React 19 Features**: Master Server Components, actions, and new hooks with TypeScript
- **Advanced Patterns**: Implement HOCs, render props, and polymorphic components safely
- **State Management**: Type context, reducers, and modern state solutions effectively
- **Performance**: Optimize React apps while maintaining type safety
- **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for TypeScript React applications
- **Tooling**: Configure ESLint, Prettier, and build tools for the best DX

## Who This Course Is For

This material is designed for:

- **React developers** wanting to add robust type safety to their applications
- **TypeScript developers** learning React-specific patterns and best practices
- **Teams** looking to establish consistent, type-safe development practices
- **Library authors** building reusable React components with great TypeScript support

## Course Structure

The course is organized into logical progressions from foundations to advanced topics:

1. **Start with TypeScript fundamentals** and React 19 setup
2. **Master component typing patterns** from basic props to complex compositions
3. **Explore advanced patterns** like polymorphic and compound components
4. **Learn state management** with context, reducers, and external libraries
5. **Dive into React 19 features** including Server Components and new hooks
6. **Handle forms and events** with full type safety
7. **Optimize for performance** without sacrificing type correctness
8. **Set up comprehensive testing** and development tooling
9. **Implement advanced patterns** with generics and utility types
10. **Deploy and publish** type-safe component libraries

## Key Benefits

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Build React applications with confidence using TypeScript's type system
- Catch runtime errors at compile time with proper typing strategies
- Create reusable, well-typed component libraries
- Work effectively with React 19's latest features and TypeScript
- Set up development environments optimized for React TypeScript development
- Write maintainable code that scales with your team and application size
