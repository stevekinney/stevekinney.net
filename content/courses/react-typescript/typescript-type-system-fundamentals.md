Before you can master React with TypeScript, you need to understand how TypeScript thinks about types. It's not like Java or C# where types are about classes and inheritance. TypeScript uses structural typing—if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, TypeScript says it's a duck. This fundamental difference changes everything about how you write and think about types.

Let's build a rock-solid foundation in TypeScript's type system. Once you understand these core concepts, every React pattern will make more sense, every error message will be clearer, and you'll write types that actually help rather than hinder.

## Structural Typing: The Foundation

TypeScript doesn't care about names or declarations—it cares about shape. This is the most important concept to internalize. Unlike nominally-typed languages like Java or C#, TypeScript uses structural typing where type compatibility is determined by the structure of the types, not their names.

**See: [Structural Typing in TypeScript](typescript-structural-typing.md)** for comprehensive coverage including:

- Duck typing patterns
- Excess property checking
- React props and component composition
- Class compatibility rules
- Real-world patterns and best practices

## Type Inference: Let TypeScript Do the Work

TypeScript is incredibly good at figuring out types. Understanding when to let inference work and when to be explicit is key to writing clean, maintainable code with less boilerplate.

**See: [Type Inference Mastery](typescript-type-inference-mastery.md)** for comprehensive coverage including:

- When to rely on inference vs being explicit
- Contextual typing patterns
- Const assertions and literal types
- React-specific inference patterns
- Performance considerations

## Type Narrowing: Progressive Type Refinement

TypeScript understands control flow and narrows types based on your code's logic. This enables you to write safer code with precise type checking.

**See: [Type Narrowing and Control Flow](typescript-type-narrowing-control-flow.md)** for comprehensive coverage including:

- Type guards (typeof, instanceof, in operator)
- Custom type guards and assertion functions
- Control flow analysis
- Discriminated unions and exhaustiveness checking
- React-specific narrowing patterns

## Type Safety with `unknown` and `any`

Understanding the difference between `unknown` and `any` is crucial for type safety. While `any` disables type checking, `unknown` requires you to validate types before use.

**See: [`unknown` vs `any`](typescript-unknown-vs-any.md)** for comprehensive coverage including:

- Why `any` is dangerous and how it spreads
- Safe handling of dynamic types with `unknown`
- The `never` type for exhaustiveness checking
- Migration strategies from `any` to `unknown`
- Real-world patterns for type-safe API handling

## Type Aliases vs Interfaces

When to use `type` vs `interface` is a common question in TypeScript. While both can describe object shapes, they each have unique capabilities.

**Key Differences:**

- **Interfaces** are best for object shapes, support declaration merging, and work well with classes
- **Type aliases** can represent any type (unions, tuples, primitives), support intersection types, and work with mapped/conditional types

**Quick Guidelines:**

```typescript
// Use interface for object shapes
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}

// Use type for unions, functions, and complex types
type Status = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
type Handler = (event: Event) => void;
type Nullable<T> = T | null;
```

For more patterns with type aliases and interfaces, see:

- **[Unions, Intersections, and Guards](typescript-unions-intersections-guards.md)** for union and intersection patterns
- **[Utility Types](typescript-utility-types-complete.md)** for advanced type transformations

## Literal Types and Template Literals

TypeScript's literal types allow you to specify exact values as types, enabling precise type checking and powerful string manipulation patterns.

**See: [Template Literal Types](typescript-template-literal-types.md)** for comprehensive coverage including:

- String, numeric, and boolean literal types
- Template literal type patterns
- String manipulation utilities
- Dynamic property names and event handlers
- Real-world React patterns

## Type Assertions and Casting

Sometimes you know more than TypeScript about a value's type. Type assertions let you override TypeScript's inferred type, but use them carefully—they bypass type safety.

**Common Patterns:**

- `as` syntax for type assertions (preferred in JSX)
- Non-null assertion operator (`!`) when you're certain a value exists
- `as const` for literal type inference
- Assertion functions for runtime type validation

**See: [Type Narrowing and Control Flow](typescript-type-narrowing-control-flow.md)** for safer alternatives using:

- Type guards instead of assertions
- Assertion functions with runtime checks
- Control flow analysis for automatic narrowing

## Function Types and Overloads

Functions in TypeScript support powerful typing patterns including overloads, optional parameters, and callable interfaces.

**Key Concepts:**

- Function type expressions for defining function signatures
- Function overloads for multiple call signatures
- Optional and rest parameters
- Functions with properties

**Related Topics:**

- **[Generics Deep Dive](typescript-generics-deep-dive.md)** for generic function patterns
- **[Type Narrowing](typescript-type-narrowing-control-flow.md)** for type guard functions

```typescript
// Quick example: Function overloads
function parse(value: string): object;
function parse(value: number): string;
function parse(value: string | number): object | string {
  return typeof value === 'string' ? JSON.parse(value) : value.toString();
}
```

## Generic Functions and Type Parameters

Generics enable writing reusable, type-safe functions that work with any type while maintaining type relationships.

**See: [TypeScript Generics Deep Dive](typescript-generics-deep-dive.md)** for comprehensive coverage including:

- Generic functions, interfaces, and classes
- Type constraints and conditional types
- React component generics
- Advanced patterns with multiple type parameters
- Real-world applications and best practices

## Index Signatures and Dynamic Types

TypeScript provides several ways to work with objects that have dynamic property names.

**Key Patterns:**

- Index signatures for dynamic property access
- Record types for mapping keys to values
- Template literal patterns for property names

**See Advanced Coverage:**

- **[Conditional and Mapped Types](typescript-conditional-mapped-types.md)** for mapped type transformations
- **[Template Literal Types](typescript-template-literal-types.md)** for template literal patterns
- **[Utility Types](typescript-utility-types-complete.md)** for Record, Partial, and other utilities

```typescript
// Quick example: Record type
type Status = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
type StatusMessages = Record<Status, string>;

const messages: StatusMessages = {
  idle: 'Ready',
  loading: 'Please wait...',
  success: 'Complete!',
  error: 'Something went wrong',
};
```

## Module Systems and Type Declarations

Understanding TypeScript's module system is crucial for organizing code and working with external libraries.

**See: [Modules and Declarations](typescript-modules-declarations.md)** for comprehensive coverage including:

- ES modules and CommonJS interop
- Type-only imports and exports
- Declaration files for JavaScript libraries
- Module augmentation patterns
- Namespace and global type declarations

## Best Practices and Mental Models

### Start Specific, Widen as Needed

```typescript
// ❌ Too wide initially
function processData(data: any) {
  // No type safety
}

// ✅ Start specific
function processUser(user: User) {
  // Full type safety
}

// ✅ Widen when needed with generics
function processEntity<T extends { id: string }>(entity: T) {
  // Flexible but safe
}
```

### Use Union Types for States

```typescript
// ❌ Multiple booleans
interface BadState {
  isLoading: boolean;
  isError: boolean;
  isSuccess: boolean;
}

// ✅ Union types
type GoodState =
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'error'; error: Error }
  | { status: 'success'; data: Data };
```

### Prefer Type Inference

```typescript
// ❌ Unnecessary annotations
const name: string = 'Alice';
const age: number = 30;
const user: { name: string; age: number } = { name, age };

// ✅ Let TypeScript infer
const name = 'Alice';
const age = 30;
const user = { name, age };
```

### Make Invalid States Unrepresentable

```typescript
// ❌ Invalid states possible
interface BadForm {
  isSubmitting: boolean;
  isSuccess: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

// ✅ Invalid states impossible
type GoodForm =
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'submitting' }
  | { status: 'success'; data: FormData }
  | { status: 'error'; error: string };
```

## Wrapping Up

These fundamentals form the bedrock of TypeScript understanding. Structural typing teaches you to think in shapes, not names. Type inference shows you when to write types and when to let TypeScript work. Type narrowing reveals how TypeScript understands your code's flow. And the distinction between `unknown` and `any` keeps your code safe.

Master these concepts, and React TypeScript patterns will feel natural. You'll write types that help rather than hinder, catch bugs at compile time, and build applications with confidence. The type system isn't a burden—it's your most powerful tool for writing robust, maintainable code.
