This comprehensive course material covers everything you need to build performant React applications, from understanding performance fundamentals to implementing advanced optimization techniques. Learn to identify bottlenecks, apply the right optimizations, and leverage React 19's latest performance features including the React Compiler.

> [!TODO] Prerequisites
>
> - Solid understanding of React fundamentals (components, hooks, state management)
> - Experience with modern JavaScript and React development
> - Basic familiarity with browser developer tools
> - Understanding of component lifecycles and rendering behavior

## What You'll Learn

This course covers the complete spectrum of React performance optimization:

- **Performance Measurement**: Master browser DevTools, Core Web Vitals, and performance profiling
- **State Management**: Optimize state colocation, lifting, and avoid unnecessary re-renders
- **Memoization Strategies**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback effectively without over-optimization
- **React 19 Features**: Leverage the React Compiler, concurrent features, and new performance APIs
- **Server-Side Performance**: Optimize SSR, streaming, hydration, and React Server Components
- **Bundle Optimization**: Implement code splitting, tree shaking, and analyze bundle performance
- **Production Monitoring**: Set up Real User Monitoring and performance budgets

## Who This Course Is For

This material is designed for:

- **React developers** looking to optimize application performance systematically
- **Senior developers** wanting to master advanced performance patterns and techniques
- **Teams** building large-scale React applications that need to perform at scale
- **Technical leads** responsible for performance standards and monitoring strategies

## Course Structure

The course progresses from fundamentals to advanced optimization techniques:

1. **Master performance fundamentals** with proper measurement and monitoring tools
2. **Optimize state management** patterns to prevent unnecessary renders
3. **Apply memoization strategically** without falling into over-optimization traps
4. **Leverage React 19 features** including the compiler and concurrent rendering
5. **Optimize server-side rendering** with streaming, hydration, and RSC patterns
6. **Optimize bundle performance** with code splitting and build tool configurations
7. **Implement production monitoring** with Core Web Vitals and performance budgets
8. **Apply advanced techniques** for animations, virtualization, and memory management

## Key Performance Areas Covered

By the end of this course, you'll master:

- **Render Optimization**: Prevent unnecessary renders through proper component design
- **Bundle Performance**: Reduce bundle size and improve loading performance
- **Runtime Performance**: Optimize interactions, animations, and user experience
- **Server Performance**: Leverage SSR, streaming, and React Server Components effectively
- **Memory Management**: Detect and prevent memory leaks in React applications
- **Production Monitoring**: Track and improve real-world performance metrics
