I'm [Steve](/), the head of frontend engineering at [Temporal](https://temporal.io) I'm excited to guide you through [Figma](https://figma.com) from a developer's perspective. Our journey into Figma is not just about design; it's about creating a bridge between design and development, making it easier for teams to collaborate and build amazing user interfaces.

## Why Figma for Developers?

A lot of the content out there around using Figma is—naturally—written by and for designers. In this course, we're going to to learn how to use Figma from the perspective of an frontend or full-stack software engineer. Yes, that means we can make jokes about prototypal inheritance and other peculiarities of the JavaScript programming language.

Not only will you learn how to use Figma, but my goal is to empower you to be a better collaborator with the designers on your team when it comes developer handoff. In addition to learning _how_ to use Figma, we'll pick up a bunch of skills that will make it easier to implement designs created in Figma into our applications and software projects. You'll also learn how to use Figma for those situations where _you_ need to play the role of a designer.

If you're a designer, this course is _also_ for you. You'll learn how to structure your designs to make your friendly neighborhood developers' lives easier.

By the end of this course, you'll not only be proficient in using Figma but also understand how to translate designs into code, contribute to a design system, and work effectively with designers. Whether converting from Photoshop or integrating with tools like Storybook, you'll gain insights into making Figma a pivotal part of your development workflow.
