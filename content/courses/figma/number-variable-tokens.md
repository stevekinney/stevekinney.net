The core value proposition of [variables](variables.md) is that they store single values that make it easy for us to change across all of our designs later. You can implement [a full set of spacing values like found in Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing#default-spacing-scale)—and this might make total sense as a basis for your primitives—or you may choose to use a curated, more-limited set.

For our purposes, we're going to create a limited set of tokens. You can always expand if needed.
