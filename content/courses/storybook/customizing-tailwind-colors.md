title: Customizing the Colors in Our Theme
description: Changing or replacing the colors in the built-in Tailwind theme.

Our design system has it's own color system. Luckily, we can swap out the one included in Tailwind fairly easily. To save you the hassle of putting it together yourself, I included an implementation in `src/tokens/colors.ts` that you can use.

You have two choices here:

1. Extend the color theme included in Tailwind
2. Replace it all together.

I am going to argue that we should replace it so that our fellow developers don't actually use the built-in colors.

Now, we'll just replace the built-in colors in the theme with our bespoke color palette.

```ts
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';
import { colors, white, black, transparent, currentColor } from './src/tokens/colors';

export default {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,mdx,html}'],
  darkMode: ['class', '[data-mode="dark"]'],
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...colors,
      white,
      black,
      transparent,
      currentColor,
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
} satisfies Config;
```

## Integrating Our Theme

There are three ways to use our new Tailwind theme in our component:

1. Use the `theme()` CSS function provided by Tailwind via PostCSS.
2. Use the `@apply` directive provided by Tailwind via PostCSS.
3. Rewrite the component using Tailwind's utility classes.

The third option is probably our best betâ€”and we'll do that one in a second, but that might be easier said than done in a legacy codebase. So, let's look at the first two.

### Using the Theme Function

Using the first approach, we can go through and replace the values with references to our theme.

```diff
 .button {
   align-items: center;
-  background-color: #8a55c8;
+  background-color: theme('colors.primary.600', #8a55c8);
   border-color: transparent;
   border-radius: 0.25rem;
   border-width: 1px;
```

### Using Apply

Alternatively, we can apply Tailwind's utility classes to our existing classes.

```diff
 .button {
-  align-items: center;
-  background-color: #8a55c8;
-  border-color: transparent;
-  border-radius: 0.25rem;
-  border-width: 1px;
-  box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
-  color: white;
-  cursor: pointer;
-  display: inline-flex;
-  font-weight: 600;
-  gap: 0.375rem;
-  padding: 0.375rem 0.625rem;
-  transition: background-color 0.2s;
+  @apply bg-primary-600 inline-flex cursor-pointer items-center gap-1.5 rounded border border-transparent px-2.5 py-1.5 text-white shadow-sm transition-colors;
 }
```
