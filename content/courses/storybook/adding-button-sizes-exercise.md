Buttons can come in all shapes and sizes, the buttons in our design system come in four sizes—`extra-small`, `small`, `medium`, and `large` —with `medium` being the default size. Here is some CSS to get us started. This is included in `button.module.css`.

```css
.small {
	font-size: 0.875rem;
	padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;
}

.medium {
	font-size: 0.875rem;
	padding: 0.375rem 0.625rem;
}

.large {
	font-size: 0.875rem;
	padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem;
}
```

When you're ready, we can walk through [a solution](adding-button-sizes-solution.md).
