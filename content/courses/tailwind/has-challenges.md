Can you implement the following?

1. **Checkbox Container**: Make a container change background color when its checkbox is checked. (Easy mode, you can find the answer somewhere in the last section.)
2. **Form Validation Feedback**: Create a form field container that shows different colors for valid/invalid states
3. **Conditional Content**: Build a survey question that reveals follow-up content based on radio button selection
4. **Multi-Element Response**: Design a contact form container that responds differently to text inputs vs textareas
5. **Complex Attribute Targeting**: Create a file upload zone that responds to both focus states and file type attributes

The [solutions can be found here](has-solutions).
