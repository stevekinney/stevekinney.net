Setting up Tailwind CSS properly in your development environment is pretty simpleâ€”if you follow the happy path, at least.

Tailwind CSS offers multiple installation methods to fit different project setups and requirements. We'll cover the two most popular approaches: using Vite for modern build workflows and the Tailwind CLI for simpler setups.

## Vite Integration

Vite has become one of the most popular build tools for modern web development, and it works exceptionally well with Tailwind CSS. You can check out the official instructions for [using Tailwind with Vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite).

But, basically, this is it:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tailwindcss()],
});
```

### Adding Tailwind to Your CSS

Simply import Tailwind in your CSS file:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
```

This single import replaces the traditional three directives and provides better performance with faster builds.
