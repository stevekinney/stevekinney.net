Welcome to this comprehensive course on modern web design with Tailwind CSS! Whether you are new to utility-first CSS or are looking to upgrade your skills to the latest version, this course will provide you with a solid foundation and guide you through advanced topics.

## Who is this course for?

This course is designed for web developers who have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Familiarity with JavaScript and a component-based framework (like Svelte, React, or Vue) is helpful but not strictly required. We will focus on:

- Developers who want to build modern, responsive interfaces without writing custom CSS.
- Designers who want to understand how to implement their vision using a systematic design framework.
- Teams looking to build a consistent and maintainable design system.

## What will you learn?

We will cover a wide range of topics, from the fundamentals of utility-first styling to advanced techniques for theming, animations, and accessibility.

Here's a brief overview of the course structure:

### Part 1: Getting Started

We will begin by setting up our development environment and understanding the core concepts that make Tailwind CSS so powerful.

- **Introduction to Utility-First:** A deep dive into the "why" behind Tailwind.
- **Setup and Configuration:** Integrating Tailwind with Vite and exploring the `tailwind.config.js` file.
- **Core Concepts:** Practical examples of responsive design, states, and dark mode.

This section is a deep dive into the most common and powerful utility classes that you will use every day.

### Part 4: Advanced Topics

Finally, we'll explore advanced features to take your skills to the next level.

- **Animations and Transitions:** Bringing your interfaces to life with custom animations and smooth transitions.
