These are _all_ of my notes for the [Tailwind 4 course for Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/tailwind-css-v2/). It's definitely a lot more that we could ever hope to cover in a day, so you can treat some of this material as further research. But, more importantlyâ€”most of the topics that I do _cover_ in the course are also outlined here step-by-step for your reference.

## Who is This Course For?

This course is designed for web developers who have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Familiarity with JavaScript and a component-based framework (like Svelte, React, or Vue) is helpful but not strictly required. We will focus on:

- Developers who want to build modern, responsive interfaces without writing custom CSS.
- Designers who want to understand how to implement their vision using a systematic design framework.
- Teams looking to build a consistent and maintainable design system.
