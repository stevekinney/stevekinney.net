Behold, the `<button>`. After Tailwind strips most of the built-in browser styles as part of it's [Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight). In fact, it barely looks like a button.

```html tailwind
<button>Button</button>
```

We can begin to add a little more to it by using **utility classes**.

Utility-first CSS prioritizes small, single-purpose classes applied directly to HTML elements instead of semantic classes or IDs. Each utility class does one thing—sets margin, padding, text alignment, or color.

```html tailwind
<button class="bg-blue-600 px-3 py-2 text-white">Button</button>
```

Tailwind pushes the utility-first philosophy further by embracing modern CSS features—cascade layers, OKLCH colors, container queries, and native custom properties—all without leaving HTML.

## Advantages

1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Style elements directly in HTML without switching files.
2. **Reduced Side Effects**: Classes scoped to individual elements prevent styling conflicts.
3. **Reusability**: Single-purpose classes work across the entire application.
4. **Maintainability**: Effects of adding/removing classes are predictable and visible in markup.
5. **Easy to Extend**: Frameworks provide customization options for consistent design systems.

## Criticisms

1. **Verbose HTML**: Numerous class names can clutter markup.
2. **Learning Curve**: Requires familiarity with utility class names.
3. **Lack of Semantics**: Utility classes don't convey element meaning (mitigated by combining with semantic classes).

### Why It Works

- **Predictable cascade**: Utilities declared last in the cascade override component and base styles without `!important`.
- **Design-token synergy**: Tokens in `@theme` (`--color-primary-500`) are available in every utility.
- **Rapid iteration**: Oxide rebuilds styles in milliseconds.

### Best Practices

- **Compose in HTML first**: Reach for custom CSS only when utilities can't express the idea clearly.
- **Extract repeating patterns**: Wrap utilities appearing 3+ times in components or `@apply`.
- **Use `@apply` sparingly**: Selectors in `@layer components/base` don't receive variants. For variant-aware helpers, use `@utility`.
- **Declare tokens in `@theme`**: Use CSS variables for spacing, colors, fonts instead of arbitrary values (`p-[123px]`).

### Managing Long Class Lists

Keep long class lists readable:

1. **Logical grouping**: Order by layout → spacing → typography → color → motion.
2. **Automatic sorting**: Use official [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) or the Prettier Tailwind plugin to enforce consistent ordering.
3. **Component extraction**: Pull verbose patterns into reusable components to keep markup tidy.

### Advanced Variants & State

Tailwind 4 introduces powerful variant primitives:

| Variant               | Purpose                                 | Example                          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `md:`                 | Media query ≥ 768px                     | `md:grid-cols-3`                 |
| `hover:`              | Interaction state                       | `hover:bg-primary-600`           |
| `cq:`                 | Container query                         | `cq:gap-6`                       |
| `group-has-[.active]` | Style parent when it contains `.active` | `group-has-[.active]:bg-blue-50` |

Combine them for expressive rules like `md:group-hover/cell:translate-y-1`.

### Performance Considerations

- **Oxide build step**: Tailwind emits only referenced classes for minimal CSS bundles.
- **Avoid runtime JIT in prod**: Compile-time is faster with no client-side overhead.
- **Mind variant explosion**: Each variant combination adds bytes. Prune unused classes.

### Knowing When to Write Custom CSS

Use custom CSS when:

- Complex keyframe animations are needed
- Algorithmic values required (e.g., trig‑based transforms).
- Selector logic exceeds what utility variants offer.

Keep such rules small, place them in the correct cascade layer, and document why utilities weren’t sufficient.
