I write a lot of words, but most of them are for the [courses](/courses) that I teach with my buddies at [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) or in some other pseudo-professional capacity. That said, I've occasionally mustered up the will power and discipline to write a few words that I'm _not_ being paid for. This is a completeâ€”if underwhelmingâ€”list. I fully intend to start writing more in the futureâ€”but, we'll see how that goes. ðŸ˜›

<ul class="space-y-8 not-prose">
	{#each data.posts as post}
	<li class="block">
		<a href="/writing/{post.slug}" class="group grid grid-cols-[50px_1fr] gap-4 bg-primary-50 border-primary-200 dark:border-primary-700 dark:bg-primary-800 border p-4 rounded-md hover:border-primary-300">
		<NotebookPen size={28} class="m-2" />
		<div>
			<h3 class="font-semibold sm:text-xl group-hover:underline decoration-primary-200 decoration-4 group-hover:decoration-primary-400">{post.title}</h3>
			<DateTime date={post.date} />
