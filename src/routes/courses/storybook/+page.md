## Prerequisities

You'll need the following in order to follow along with this course. You'll have a chance to get set up with everything along the way. But, if you want to get a head start, get yourself set up with the tools below.

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [A Chromatic account](https://www.chromatic.com/)

## Libraries and Tools Used

In addition to Storybook, we'll also be leveraging some other libraries along the way. They'll be included in any of the example repositories where they're needed, but I figured it'd be helpful to list them all in one place as well
