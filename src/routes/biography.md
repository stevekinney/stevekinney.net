## Hi, I'm Steve.

I'm a teacher and software engineer from [Denver, Colorado, USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver). Right now, I'm [the head of front-end engineering at Temporal](https://temporal.io). I also teach [courses and workshops](/courses) with [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/steve-kinney).

Prior to [Temporal](https://temporal.io), I was the front-end architect at [Twilio](https://twilio.com) and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com). And before that, I was the founder of the [front-end engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/frontend).

I'm the co-founder and organizer of the currently-in-hibernation, [DinosaurJS conference](https://dinosaurjs.org) in Denver, Colorado. In my copious free-time, I wrote a book, [Electron in Action](https://bit.ly/electronjs) that is pretty out of date at this point and I can't recommend anymore. Time is funny like that.
