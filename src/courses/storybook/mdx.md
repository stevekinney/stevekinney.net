title: Documenting Components with MDX

Storybook allows you to document components using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which is basically just Markdown + JSX.

This allows _a lot_ more flexibility when it comes to how you display your components, stories, controls, and—of course—documentation.

> [!NOTE] Storybook and MDX only supports React.
> Your components and stories can be in any framework that Storybook supports, but your MDX files will use React.

By default, MDX will pick up any `.mdx` files in your project. But, you _can_ configure it, if you want.

```ts
import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/react-vite';

const config: StorybookConfig = {
	/**
	 * Change the setting below if you want to be a bit more specific
	 * about where you want Storybook to go looking for MDX files.
	 */
	stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)'],
	// The rest of your configuration…
};
export default config;
```

Let's start with something simple just to demonstrate how MDX works and then we'll get into some of the more specific Storybook-related tricks. Let's create `src/components/button/button.mdx`.

```mdx
import { Button } from './button';

# Component System

Welcome to our dope component library. This is a collection of components that we use in our projects. We hope you find them useful.

<Button>Wow, a button!</Button>
```

## Doc Blocks

The _real_ power—or, at least the Storybook-related power—comes mixing in `@storybook/blocks` into your documentation. Doc blocks allow you to take pieces of the stories that we've been working with so far and integrating them into your prose.

```mdx
import { Meta, Title, Primary, Controls, Story } from '@storybook/blocks';
import * as ButtonStories from './button.stories';

<Meta of={ButtonStories} />

<Title>Button</Title>

A button is a thing that you press in order to make stuff happen.

<Primary />

## Controls

Buttons have lots of little things that you can tweak about them.

<Controls />
```

Let's talk about what's going on here:

- We're importing all of the exports from our button stories.
- We're importing the `Meta` block from `@storybook/blocks` in order to attach our documentation to our component.
- The `Primary` block renders the first-defined story in our `button.stories.tsx` file. It's purely coincidental that it happens that my first export is _also_ named **Primary**.
- There is some more prose and then re render the `Controls`, which is analogous to what we've seen so far.
