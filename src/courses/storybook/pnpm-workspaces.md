For the purposes of organizing our design system, we're going to be taking advantange of [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

This will allow us to break out our design system into it's component parts and make it easier to publish each piece seperately.

> [!NOTE] pnpm is a prerequisite
> You will need to have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed on your machine before continuing.
