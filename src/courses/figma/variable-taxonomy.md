Naming things is hard and we're constantly going back and forth about the best way to organize and name our variables, styles, and components. I've found that I like to at least take some inspiration from [Twilio Paste's design tokens](https://paste.twilio.design/tokens#token-naming).

> [!QUOTE] From Paste's documentation
> Tokens are named semantically to specify their intended usage. The format of a design token name is:Â **`$type-category-instance-variant-state`**
