As we learned with [components](components.md) and dug into a little bit with [placeholder components](placeholder-components.md), components can't take what slotted children but we can do a one-for-one swap. But what if we want to swap in more than one component? One trick we can use is called **cropped grid components**.

We're going to set up a frame to serve as out checklist component. And then fill it up with more stuff—in this case, the **Checklist Item** component that we made in [previous section](building-a-checkbox-component.md)—than we need.

1. Create an empty frame.
2. Drag in one **Checklist Item** component.
3. Duplicate it multiple times.
4. Set the constraints to have it move along the top and then the center of the parent.
