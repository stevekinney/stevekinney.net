A lot of existing tooling works better with styles than they do with variables. Also, you might be working with a design that predates variables and want to convert your styles into variables. In either case, [this plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1253585487427690087/styles-to-variables-converter) can be super helpful.
